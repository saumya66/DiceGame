# DiceGame
Hey there, So this my first Vanilla JavaScript Game .

GAME RULES:

1. The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
2. In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his Total score.
3. But, if the player rolls 1 on both the dices, all his Current Round's score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
4. But the player can pravent that by choosing to 'HOLD', which means that his Current Round's score gets added to his Total score.    After that, it's the next player's turn.
5. The first player to reach Winning Score(Default:100 OR the Score you set in the WIN SCORE box) as Total score & pressing 'HOLD'      button wins the game !
